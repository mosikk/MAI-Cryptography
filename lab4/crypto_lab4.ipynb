       "'chapter i  well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes but i warn you if you dont tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichristi really believe he is antichristi will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened yousit down and tell me all the news  it was in july 1805 and the speaker was the wellknown anna pavlovna scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the elite  all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows  if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10annette scherer  heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa  first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your friends mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned  can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the whole evening i hope  and the fete at the english ambassadors today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for me to take me there  i thought todays fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome  if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a woundup clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed  dont tease well and what has been decided about novosiltsevs dispatch you know everything  what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours  prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct  in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out  oh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexanders loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe  she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity  i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea  in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard  i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature  prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron  anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with  baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone  as she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness  the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said  now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful  the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude  i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversationi often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i dont speak of anatole your youngest i dont like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you dont deserve to have them  and she smiled her ecstatic smile  i cant help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity  dont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her majestys and you were pitied  the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned  what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant  and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively  i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it cant be helped  he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated  have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i dont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya  prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information  do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added thats what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich  her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the wellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an aidedecamp of kutuzovs and will be here tonight  listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna pavlovnas hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slaveslafe with an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and thats all i want  and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction  attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting ill speak to lise young bolkonskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my apprenticeship as old maid     chapter ii  anna pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling the highest petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged prince vasilis daughter the beautiful helene came to take her father to the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg  was also there she had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions prince vasilis son hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come    the most fascinating woman in petersburg  to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovna mentioned each ones name and then left them  each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of her majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening  the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold embroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defectthe shortness of her upper lip and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day  the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast  soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna pavlovna  you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene  what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili to anna pavlovna  one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with closecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionable at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a wellknown grandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of this lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room  it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her  pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance  anna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys health anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbe morio he is a most interesting man  yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasible  you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbes plan chimerical  we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile  and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe  pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna pavlovnas was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the selfconfident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing     chapter iii  anna pavlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the aunt beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed round the abbe another of young people was grouped round the beautiful princess helene prince vasilis daughter and the little princess bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovna  the vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests as a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna served up to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choice morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc denghien had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons for buonapartes hatred of him  ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovna with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in the sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte  the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to listen to his tale  the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to one of the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to another how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish  the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile  come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center of another group  the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautiful woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back and bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effect  how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile  madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilingly inclining his head  the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsed into her radiant smile  the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene  wait a moment ill get my work now then what are you thinking of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag  there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat  now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she took up her work  prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her  le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like his sisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous self satisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self confidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions  its not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak  why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging his shoulders  because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them  he spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed in a darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings  the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then current to the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter spared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death  the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked agitated  charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess  charming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it  the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to the rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young mans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why anna pavlovna disapproved  the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of the people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for one powerful nation like russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save the world  but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning  at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely at pierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate the italians face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women  i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society more especially of the feminine society in which i have had the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think of the climate said he  not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the more conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the larger circle     chapter iv  just then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna pavlovnas hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company  you are off to the war prince said anna pavlovna  general kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing the last syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has been pleased to take me as an aidedecamp  and lise your wife  she will go to the country  are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife  andre said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte  prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked round prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile  there now so you too are in the great world said he to pierre  i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper with you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story  no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing pierres hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass  you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna  his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him  very lovely said prince andrew  very said pierre  in passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to anna pavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women  anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his father to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear  how about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him into the anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i may take back to my poor boy  although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go away  what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would be transferred to the guards at once said she  believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be the best way  the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son it was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat listening to the vicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she smiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightly  listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my fathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake to do this for my sonand i shall always regard you as a benefactor she added hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have asked golitsyn and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes  papa we shall be late said princess helene turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door  influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but in princess drubetskayas case he felt after her second appeal something like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women mostly motherswho having once made up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes this last consideration moved him  my dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your fathers memory i will do the impossibleyour son shall be transferred to the guards here is my hand on it are you satisfied  my dear benefactor this is what i expected from youi knew your kindness he turned to go  waitjust a word when he has been transferred to the guards she faltered you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov recommend boris to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest and then  prince vasili smiled  no i wont promise that you dont know how kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants  no but do promise i wont let you go my dear benefactor  papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we shall be late  well au revoir goodbye you hear her  then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor  certainly but about kutuzov i dont promise  do promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came naturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn face  apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it would be time to leave her task was accomplished     chapter v  and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milan asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to make ones head whirl it is as if the whole world had gone crazy  prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile  dieu me la donne gare a qui la touche  they say he was very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian dio mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi    god has given it to me let him who touches it beware  i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything  the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper  and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position  prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it  baton de gueules engrele de gueules dazurmaison conde said he  the princess listened smiling  if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far by intrigues violence exile and executions french societyi mean good french societywill have been forever destroyed and then  he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovna who had him under observation interrupted  the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government and i believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant  that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime  from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to bonapartes side  it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion  bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile  it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though without looking at him  i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince andrew continued after a short silence again quoting napoleons words i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how far he was justified in saying so  not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some people he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth  before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomtes epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to stop him  the execution of the duc denghien declared monsieur pierre was a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed  dieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper  what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her work nearer to her  oh oh exclaimed several voices  capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand  the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued  i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good he could not stop short for the sake of one mans life  wont you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovna  but pierre continued his speech without heeding her  no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the pressand only for that reason did he obtain power  yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called him a great man remarked the vicomte  he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind  what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that but wont you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovna  rousseaus contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile  i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas  yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voice  those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important what is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force  liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were highsounding words which have long been discredited who does not love liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it  prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of pierres outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience was horrorstruck but when she saw that pierres sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator  but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a ducor even an ordinary man whois innocent and untried  i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the 18th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at all like the conduct of a great man  and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shoulders  hes a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte  pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness  the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were silent  how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it seems to me  yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement  one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify  prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of pierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go  suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated began  i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it excuse me vicomtei must tell it in russian or the point will be lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story  there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her taste and she had a ladys maid also big she said  here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty  she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls  here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however smile  she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew  and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where     chapter vi  having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave  pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absent minded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals threecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it all his absentmindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre  when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow i am and everyone including anna pavlovna felt this  prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass  go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess taking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a low voice  anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess sisterinlaw  i rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tone write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoir and she left the hall  prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face close to her began to whisper something  two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh  i am very glad i did not go to the ambassadors said prince hippolyte so dull it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful  they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be there  not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as though embracing her  still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he seem  are you ready he asked his wife looking past her  prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage  princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet  the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under pretense of helping was in everyones way  allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path  i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and affectionately  the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home  well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing  do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch  hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to know how to deal with them  pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrews study like one quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesars commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle  what have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill now said prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands  pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand  that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible buti do not know how to express it not by a balance of political power  it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation  one cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence  pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him  really i dont yet know i dont like either the one or the other  but you must decide on something your father expects it  pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to anything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money write to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed his forehead  but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening  that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us talk business have you been to the horse guards  no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not right  prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierres childish words he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question  if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars he said  and that would be splendid said pierre  prince andrew smiled ironically  very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about  well why are you going to the war asked pierre  what for i dont know i must besides that i am going he paused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me     chapter vii  the rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room prince andrew shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had in anna pavlovnas drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa the princess came in she had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her  how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married how stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you are monsieur pierre  and i am still arguing with your husband i cant understand why he wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women  the princess started evidently pierres words touched her to the quick  ah that is just what i tell him said she i dont understand it i dont in the least understand why men cant live without wars how is it that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need it now you shall judge between us i always tell him here he is uncles aidede camp a most brilliant position he is so well known so much appreciated by everyone the other day at the apraksins i heard a lady asking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughed he is so well received everywhere he might easily become aidedecamp to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think  pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the conversation gave no reply  when are you starting he asked  oh dont speak of his going dont i wont hear it spoken of said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly illsuited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know andre she looked significantly at her husband im afraid im afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her back  her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness  what is it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said he  there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country  with my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently  alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to be afraid  her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a joyful but an animal squirrellike expression she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the gist of the matter lay in that  i still cant understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wife  the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair  no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have  your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew you had better go  the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room  pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him and now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind  why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no pity for me why is it  lise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words but she went on hurriedly  you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave like that six months ago  lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically  pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself  calm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you i myself have experienced and so because no excuse me an outsider is out of place here no dont distress yourself good bye  prince andrew caught him by the hand  no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you  no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears  lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted  suddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail  mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead  good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger     chapter viii  the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand  let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door  they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face began to talkas one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out  never never marry my dear fellow thats my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry when you are old and good for nothingor all that is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes dont look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but whats the good and he waved his arm  pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazement  my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a mans honor is safe but o god what would i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i mention this because i like you  as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna pavlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation  you dont understand why i say this he continued but it is the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince andrew and at anna pavlovnas they listen to me and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew what those society women are and women in general my father is right selfish vain stupid trivial in everythingthats what women are when you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothing nothing no dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded prince andrew  it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you  he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future  how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince andrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck by andrews lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength  even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly  my part is played out said prince andrew whats the use of talking about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughts  that smile was immediately reflected on pierres face  but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i havent the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously  prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glancefriendly and affectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of his own superiority  i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set yes youre all right choose what you will its all the same youll be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badlyall this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it  what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his shoulders women my dear fellow women  i dont understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il faut thats a different matter but the kuragins set of women women and wine i dont understand  pierre was staying at prince vasili kuragins and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrews sister  do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i cant decide or think properly about anything ones head aches and one spends all ones money he asked me for tonight but i wont go  you give me your word of honor not to go  on my honor     chapter ix  it was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of  i should like to go to kuragins thought he  but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to kuragins  reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance  cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others  i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one  mind no holding on cried another  i bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part our hands  there leave bruin alone heres a bet on  at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth  jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is petya good man cried he addressing pierre  another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily  i dont understand whats it all about  wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre  first of all you must drink  pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierres glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out  go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass or i wont let you go  no i wont said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the window  dolokhov was holding the englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre  dolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue eyes he was about twentyfive like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg  the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around  anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it he smashed a pane  you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre  pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash  take it right out or theyll think im holding on said dolokhov  is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole  firstrate said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible  dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the room all were silent  i bet fifty imperialshe spoke french that the englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very welli bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the englishman  no fifty replied the latter  all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything is that right  quite right said the englishman  anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at himthe englishman was shortbegan repeating the terms of the wager to him in english  wait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand  the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating dolokhovs words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked down  oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement  shut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs  placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light dolokhovs back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of dolokhovs shirt  i say this is folly hell be killed said this more sensible man  anatole stopped him  dont touch him youll startle him and then hell be killed eh what then eh  dolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on his seat  if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now then  saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from dolokhovs back anatole stood erect with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face  its empty  he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he smelt strongly of rum  well done fine fellow theres a bet for you devil take you came from different sides  the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window sill  gentlemen who wishes to bet with me ill do the same thing he suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a bottle ill do it bring a bottle  let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling  what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices  ill drink it lets have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window  they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying  no youll never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and ill get round him listen ill take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to s  come on then cried pierre come on and well take bruin with us  and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it     chapter x  prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna pavlovnas soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an exception made and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet he received however no appointment to kutuzovs staff despite all anna mikhaylovnas endeavors and entreaties soon after anna pavlovnas reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations the rostovs with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling bory who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august and her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join them on the march to radzivilov  it was st natalias day and the name day of two of the rostovsthe mother and the youngest daughterboth named nataly ever since the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually bringing visitors to the countess rostovas big house on the povarskaya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawingroom with the visitors who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relays  the countess was a woman of about fortyfive with a thin oriental type of face evidently worn out with childbearingshe had had twelve a languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw them off inviting them all to dinner  i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma cherehe called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone my dear whether they were above or below him in ranki thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended ma chere on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same expression on his full cheerful cleanshaven face the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but selfconfident french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he would call dmitri vasilevich a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say well dmitri youll see that things are all as they should be thats right the great thing is the serving thats it and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room  marya lvovna karagina and her daughter announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husbands portrait on it  im quite worn out by these callers however ill see her and no more she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice as if saying very well finish me off  a tall stout and proudlooking woman with a roundfaced smiling daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling  dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child at the razumovskis ball and countess apraksina i was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs then one of those conversations began which last out until at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say i am so delighted mammas health and countess apraksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherines day count bezukhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had behaved so improperly at anna pavlovnas reception  i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him  what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of count bezukhovs distress some fifteen times  thats what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police  you dont say so replied the countess  he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna prince vasilis son he and a certain dolokhov have it is said been up to heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and bezukhovs son sent back to moscow anatole kuragins father managed somehow to get his sons affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of petersburg  but what have they been up to asked the countess  they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back  what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the count dying with laughter  oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count  yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing  it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the visitor and to think it is cyril vladimirovich bezukhovs son who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have my daughters to consider  why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate  the visitor made a gesture with her hand  i should think he has a score of them  princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society  the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half whisper everyone knows count cyrils reputation he has lost count of his children but this pierre was his favorite  how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the countess i have never seen a handsomer man  he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i was saying prince vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the emperor about him so that in the case of his deathand he is so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasili forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich is my mothers second cousin hes also my borys godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the fact  prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitor  yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he is  but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut  and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he said     chapter xi  silence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave the visitors daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room it was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the guards a girl of fifteen and a plump rosyfaced boy in a short jacket  the count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in  ah here she is he exclaimed laughing my pet whose name day it is my dear pet  ma chere there is a time for everything said the countess with feigned severity you spoil her ilya she added turning to her husband  how do you do my dear i wish you many happy returns of your name day said the visitor what a charming child she added addressing the mother  this blackeyed widemouthed girl not pretty but full of lifewith childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lace frilled drawers and feet in low slipperswas just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not yet a young woman escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mothers mantillanot paying the least attention to her severe remarkand began to laugh she laughed and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock  do you see my doll mimi you see was all natasha managed to utter to her everything seemed funny she leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in  now then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the mother pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to the visitor she added she is my youngest girl  natasha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face  the visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it necessary to take some part in it  tell me my dear said she to natasha is mimi a relation of yours a daughter i suppose  natasha did not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish things she did not reply but looked at her seriously  meanwhile the younger generation boris the officer anna mikhaylovnas son nicholas the undergraduate the counts eldest son sonya the counts fifteenyearold niece and little petya his youngest boy had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms from which they had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing than the drawingroom talk of society scandals the weather and countess apraksina now and then they glanced at one another hardly able to suppress their laughter  the two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike boris was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate features nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say but failed boris on the contrary at once found his footing and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked right across the skull having said this he glanced at natasha she turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her boris did not laugh  you were meaning to go out werent you mamma do you want the carriage he asked his mother with a smile  yes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning his smile  boris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha the plump boy ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been disturbed     chapter xii  the only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grownup person were nicholas and sonya the niece sonya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck by the grace of her movements by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner she reminded one of a pretty halfgrown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat she evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could like natasha and boris escape from the drawing room  ah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointing to nicholas his friend boris has become an officer and so for friendships sake he is leaving the university and me his old father and entering the military service my dear and there was a place and everything waiting for him in the archives department isnt that friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone  but they say that war has been declared replied the visitor  theyve been saying so a long while said the count and theyll say so again and again and that will be the end of it my dear theres friendship for you he repeated hes joining the hussars  the visitor not knowing what to say shook her head  its not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion it is not from friendship at all i simply feel that the army is my vocation  he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation  schubert the colonel of the pavlograd hussars is dining with us today he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him it cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him  i have already told you papa said his son that if you dont wish to let me go ill stay but i know i am no use anywhere except in the army i am not a diplomat or a government clerki dont know how to hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sonya and the young lady visitor  the little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature  all right all right said the old count he always flares up this buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it he added not noticing his visitors sarcastic smile  the elders began talking about bonaparte julie karagina turned to young rostov  what a pity you werent at the arkharovs on thursday it was so dull without you said she giving him a tender smile  the young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of sonya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animation vanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and then with a distressed face left the room to find sonya  how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves said anna mikhaylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out cousinage dangereux voisinage  she added    cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood  yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one is always always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous both for girls and boys  it all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor  yes youre quite right continued the countess till now i have always thank god been my childrens friend and had their full confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shall always be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with his impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he will all the same never be like those petersburg young men  yes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussar whats one to do my dear  what a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor a little volcano  yes a regular volcano said the count takes after me and what a voice she has though shes my daughter i tell the truth when i say shell be a singer a second salomoni we have engaged an italian to give her lessons  isnt she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age  oh no not at all too young replied the count why our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen  and shes in love with boris already just fancy said the countess with a gentle smile looking at boris and went on evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her now you see if i were to be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is i know every word she utters she will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her but really that seems the best plan with her elder sister i was stricter  yes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elder daughter countess vera with a smile  but the smile did not enhance veras beauty as smiles generally do on the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant expression vera was goodlooking not at all stupid quick at learning was wellbrought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true and appropriate yet strange to say everyonethe visitors and countess aliketurned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it and they all felt awkward  people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them said the visitor  whats the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was too clever with vera said the count well what of that shes turned out splendidly all the same he added winking at vera  the guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinner  what manners i thought they would never go said the countess when she had seen her guests out     chapter xiii  when natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was already growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming at once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there  boris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face natasha very still peered out from her ambush waiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before the glass smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about to call him but changed her mind let him look for me thought she hardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears and muttering angrily came in at the other door natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her and remained in her hiding place watchingas under an invisible capto see what went on in the world she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering to herself kept looking round toward the drawingroom door it opened and nicholas came in  sonya what is the matter with you how can you said he running up to her  its nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sonya  ah i know what it is  well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her  sooonya look here how can you torture me and yourself like that for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand  sonya did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not stirring and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes what will happen now thought she  sonya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are everything said nicholas and i will prove it to you  i dont like you to talk like that  well then i wont only forgive me sonya he drew her to him and kissed her  oh how nice thought natasha and when sonya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called boris to her  boris come here said she with a sly and significant look i have something to tell you here here and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding  boris followed her smiling  what is the something asked he  she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs picked it up  kiss the doll said she  boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not reply  dont you want to well then come here said she and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll closer closer she whispered  she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flus'"

       "'tions act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined  for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the deity in human affairs  modern history in theory rejects both these principles  it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in mans subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows them in practice  instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very various kinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nations which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity modern history has postulated its own aimsthe welfare of the french german or english people or in its highest abstraction the welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent  modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the same conclusion by another road that is to recognize 1 nations guided by individual men and 2 the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending  at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions  in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs generals and ministers as being such men while another includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poets secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of the roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equality and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called europe  in 1789 a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in 1812 it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkable symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the westparisand subsides  during that twentyyear period an immense number of fields were left untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of men migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions of christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another  what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these events what force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period  for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves  if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply would have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period nor would there have been any contradictions  but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers  modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what this movement means what caused it and what force produced these events then listen  louis xiv was a very proud and selfconfident man he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain men wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other people at that time there was in france a man of geniusnapoleon he conquered everybody everywherethat is he killed many people because he was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria and prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there was an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon in 1807 he suddenly made friends with him but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperor alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace all napoleons allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects  it would be a mistake to think that this is ironica caricature of the historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period  the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has asked  if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples the first questionin the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleis what is the power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was very proud or that certain writers wrote certain books  all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is not what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons louises and writers but we do not acknowledge such a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons louises and authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations  if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be explained in what this new force consists for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force  history seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known to everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really quite well known to everybody     chapter ii  what force moves the nations  biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or in general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event the replies they give immediately lose all meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event was produced by napoleons power another that it was produced by alexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other person besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that napoleons power was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians of this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroy the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no reply to historys essential question  writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event  according to this view the power of historical personages represented as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded as a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an historic character is first the product of his time and his power only the resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a force producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of 1789 and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleons misdirected will and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced napoleons power but napoleons power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age  this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at every step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway  to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force the sum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is never observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action  specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside alexanders willsuch as the activity of stein metternich madame de stael talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian evidently decomposes alexanders power into the components talleyrand chateaubriand and the restbut the sum of the components that is the interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stael and the others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand madame de stael and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resultedthat is how component forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times athe historian is again obliged to fall back on powerthe force he had deniedand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves  peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to whether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the clouds away or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way the universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes when they want to prove something else say that power produces events  a third class of historiansthe socalled historians of culture following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsagain take that force to be something quite different they see it in what is called culturein mental activity  the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love  but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filledadmitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an ideahistorys essential question still remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians another newer forcethe ideais added the connection of which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event  undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce handicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion 1 that history is written by learned men and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history and 2 that spiritual activity enlightenment civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory  but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious philosophic and political doctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerand say plainly that that was the result of napoleons will speaking so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize     chapter iii  a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says the devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away  the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of the contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation  the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed  the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples  yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting from several other forces like the movement of the wheels others again as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown away  so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether caesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories of all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end and the only such conception known to historians is that of power  this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who breaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other method of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step  in dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to now is like money in circulationpaper money and coin the biographies and special national histories are like paper money they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires by what force did napoleon do thisthat is wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension  the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more than that paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to historys essential question what is power the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of gold so universal historians and historians of culture not answering humanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes of their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call serious reading     chapter iv  having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that mans will to the deity history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed power  a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power  napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he ordered was done  this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others  it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one a domination based on the application or threat of physical force like the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled over millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over  if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked for elsewherein the relation to the people of the man who wields the power  and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys understanding of power for true gold  power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed or tacit consent to their chosen rulers  in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation  the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded firenamely as something existing absolutely but for history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon  from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power existing immutably outside timeis but to historys questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing  if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if not then why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom he arrested  do palace revolutionsin which sometimes only two or three people take parttransfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international relations is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in 1806 was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in 1809 when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians  to these questions three answers are possible  either to assume 1 that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen and that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power or 2 that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or 3 that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance of several authorities their struggles and their falls result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others  and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers  some historiansthose biographical and specialist historians already referred toin their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of powermere violence  their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconveniencein application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one anotherthat a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children  recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually contradict one another  each historian according to his view of what constitutes a nations progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions existsthe facts of history almost always contradict that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people to this question historians reply that louis xivs activity contrary to the program reacted on louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xvwhy should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers of the peoples will from one individual to another especially in view of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning on mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a party leader so that the greater part of the events of historycivil wars revolutions and conquestsare presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the peoples will but as results of the illdirected will of one or more individuals that is once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory  these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory  historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them  but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have those leaders  the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people  but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some part of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the peoples will as some historians suppose then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the peoples life as other socalled philosophical historians believe then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we have first of all to know in what the nations life consists  met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow creatures  history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais and others  is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski  is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the louises and their ladies for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusadethe deliverance of jerusalemhad been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown  still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples  the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another  if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not the history of the life of the peoples     chapter v  the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history  the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as soon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occurthat is as soon as history beginsthat theory explains nothing  the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the peoples will cannot be verified for it never occurred  whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him  the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head  the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader this is what historians of the first class saythose who assume the unconditional transference of the peoples will  if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known with this method of observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the direction he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to the peoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one side or even in the rear  if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of their age  the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrasea restatement of the question in other words  what causes historical events power what is power power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people that is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand  if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man has besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies his reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon  not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events  whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will the event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it  the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience  on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans will his wordsare only part of the general activity expressed in an event as for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming an incomprehensible supernatural forcea miracleone cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men on the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to say their commands are often not executed and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs  without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard power as the cause of events  power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someones will and the execution of that will by others  to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to the deity  if the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient history tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore 1 the condition of all that takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands and 2 the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command     chapter vi  only the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries and only the deity independent of everything can by his sole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs  reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible  no command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole series of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event  when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet the commissariat and so on and so onmillions of commands which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia  if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly expressedthis came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case but did so correspond in the latter  for an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible not only in the case of napoleons invasion of russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and are executed  our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be apart from that the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events such for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will  we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality in all napoleons activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions of his will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series of unexecuted orders of napoleons one series for the campaign of 1812 was carried outnot because those orders differed in any way from the other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil  so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we find that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two  to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the deity but from a man which is that the man who gives the command himself takes part in the event  this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power this relation consists in the following  for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the relation between those taking part in it is always the same  men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the smaller number a less direct share in the collective action for which they have combined  of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army  every army is composed of lower grades of the servicethe rank and fileof whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher military rankcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer and of stillhigher officers of whom there are still fewer and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person  a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which will represent the commanderinchief  the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of the cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer still less often acts directly himself but commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commanderinchief never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activityin agriculture trade and every administration  and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest we see a law by which men to take associated action combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are while the less their direct participation in the action itself the more they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding  this relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power  having restored the condition of time under which all events occur we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding     chapter vii  when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many people some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it  men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power in their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity  when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity is given to directing and commanding take less part in the direct work  when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his present activity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and surmises concerning their collective activity  for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in peoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness of england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day  these justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clear mens moral responsibilities from their path  without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event how is it that millions of men commit collective crimesmake war commit murder and so on  with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men  in whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion  only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving  we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters that is reestablish the inevitable condition of all that occursthe continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses  when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement  whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ships movement also  examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it but as soon as an event occursbe it what it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events  arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history  1 what is power  2 what force produces the movement of the nations  1 power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and justifications of the collective action that is performed the less is his participation in that action  2 the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa  morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two  or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining  in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinitythat final limit to which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another  speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other words that it is a law     chapter viii  if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument but the law of history relates to man a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law  the presence of the problem of mans free will though unexpressed is felt at every step of history  all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question  if the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as he pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents  if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely that is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that mans in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity  if there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannot exist for then mans will is subject to that law  in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance  the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of viewtheological historical ethical or philosophicwe find a general law of necessity to which he like all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free  this consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from and independent of reason through his reason man observes himself but only through consciousness does he know himself  apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable  to understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all be conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of his volition but his willwhich forms the essence of his lifeman recognizes and can but recognize as free  if observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food using his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this never varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free  you say i am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it fall everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom  that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason  if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of selfconsciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable  a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as an object of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them but the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends on his organization his character and the motives acting upon him yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled  but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he does not and cannot believe this  however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases every man savage or sage however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions feels that without this irrational conception which constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feels that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would be unable to live for a single moment  he could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to life are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom  a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life  if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason  this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by experiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question  man is the creation of an allpowerful allgood and allseeing god what is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of mans freedom that is a question for theology  the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics what is mans responsibility to society the conception of which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for jurisprudence  mans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for ethics  man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life but the same man apart from that connection appears to be free how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regardedas the result of the free or as the result of the constrained activity of man that is a question for history  only in our selfconfident day of the popularization of knowledge thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of printed matterhas the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the majority of socalled advanced peoplethat is the crowd of ignoramuseshave taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem  they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has never been denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it for the fact that from the point of view of observation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theoriesthat from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a hairs breadth the solution of the question which has another opposite side based on the consciousness of freedom  if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is the time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how mans consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we can observe only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity  the naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve this question are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is now so smooth and regular     chapter ix  for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with that for history this question does not refer to the essence of mans free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions  in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science  the subject for history is not mans will itself but our presentation of it  and so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation of mans life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place  in actual life each historic event each human action is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory  to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements  whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider we always regard it as the result partly of mans free will and partly of the law of inevitability  whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of someones action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us  our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive and the more inevitability the less freedom  the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but their relation is always one of inverse proportion  a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man seem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law of necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every action of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased according to the point of view from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa  religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom  all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations  1 the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds  2 his relation to time  3 his relation to the causes leading to the action  the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the mans relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of one bound by family official or business duties seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion  if we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything around him each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to anything around him if we see his connection with anything whatever with a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he is engaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about himwe see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases  the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the mans action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man resulting in the production of the human race appear evidently less free than a mans entry into marriage today it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me  the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it  if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedly free but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being in different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from itgood agreeable and even essentialwould not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed the farther i go back in memory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action  in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear  the austroprussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyones head today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on attilas caprice the farther back in history the object of our observation lies the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability  the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each phenomenon comprehended and therefore mans every action must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow  the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear  when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a crime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality originality and independence but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedom of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates his fault in our eyes the selfsacrifice of a father or mother or selfsacrifice with the possibility of a reward is more comprehensible than gratuitous selfsacrifice and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a sect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range of examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation our conception of their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development like a child a madman or a simpletonthen knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result  on these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action     chapter x  thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a mans life  so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known where the time between the action and its examination is great and where the causes of the action are most accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on external conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom  in neither casehowever we may change our point of view however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short the period of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may becan we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity  1 to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seems to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which is evidently impossible  2 however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me the moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at that moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i made would be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine it in the present on the boundary between the past and the futurethat is outside time which is impossible  3 however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action our own or anothers the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action  but even ifimagining a man quite exempt from all influences examining only his momentary action in the present unevoked by any causewe were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a man  in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability  1 however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains  2 however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while time is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability  3 however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again we never reach absolute inevitability  but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero we assumed in some given caseas for instance in that of a dying man an unborn babe or an idiotcomplete absence of freedom by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a mans completely free action  and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time and an infinite series of causes  to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time and free from dependence on cause  in the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself that is a mere form without content  in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time and cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing or mere content without form  we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which mans whole outlook on the universe is constructedthe incomprehensible essence of life and the laws defining that essence  reason says 1 space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise 2 time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise 3 the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end  consciousness says 1 i alone am and all that exists is but me consequently i include space 2 i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living consequently i am outside time 3 i am beyond cause for i feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life  reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom  freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in mans consciousness inevitability without content is mans reason in its three forms  freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom is the content inevitability is the form  only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another as form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability  only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans life  apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content no conception of life is possible  all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason  all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence of life to the laws of reason  the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom  but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight up to newtons law so too the force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws  all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason  mans free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason just so the force of mans free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from gravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reason it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life  and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or of chemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content of astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics  in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life  so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability what is unknown we call free will free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life     chapter xi  history examines the manifestations of mans free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is it defines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws  the recognition of mans free will as something capable of influencing historical events that is as not subject to laws is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy  that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving freely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if any single action is due to free will then not a single historical law can exist nor any conception of historical events  for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of mans will in the present moves in space time and dependence on cause  the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those laws is the problem of history  from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events in mans freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible for however mans free will may be restricted as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes impossible  only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and then instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as its problem  the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the selfdestruction toward whichever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomenathe old method of history is moving  all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all unknown infinitely small elements  in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done by the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for laws history stands on the same path and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting aside the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will     chapter xii  from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seem impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after the discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time  from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence  by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of mans free will for if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic ethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause  and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics geography political economy comparative philology and geology which directly contradict its assumptions  the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation but when truth conquered theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation  just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subverting revelation  in the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the other is the passion for destruction  to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua the son of nun to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton to voltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion  just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and evil and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions  so too like voltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion though the law of inevitability in history like the law of copernicus in astronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected  as in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history now the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visible phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in history it is the independence of personalityfree will  as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths fixity and of the motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of ones own personality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do not feel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it is true that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence on the external world on time and on cause we arrive at laws  in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious'"

    "\n",
    "Выполнив данную лабораторную работу, я получил следующие результаты:  \n",
    "* точность при сравнении двух нормальных текстов = ~7%  \n",
    "* точность при сравнении текста из рандомных слов с чем-нибудь = ~6%  \n",
    "* точность при сравнении текста из рандомных букв с чем-нибудь = ~3.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "Видим, что при использовании слов (даже рандомных) точность совпадений выше, чем при использовании рандомных букв. В словах буквы связаны друг с другом: в них встречаются частые буквосочетания, частые паттерны итд. В тексте из рандомных букв между символами нет абсолютно никакой связи. Мы можем получить абсурдные сочетания букв и слов, которые маловероятно встретятся в реальном тексте.\n",
    "\n",
    "Но точность при сравнении текстов из рандомных слов и реальных текстов тоже отличается. Тексты из слов не учитывают связей между этими словами. А реальные тексты, очевидно, учитывают.\n",
    "\n",
    "При помощи таких оценок мы можем примерно понять, какой текст мы получили (допустим, он зашифрован и мы не можем просто посмотреть на него глазами, или он на незнакомом языке, или он слишком большой и мы не можем изучить его полностью). Мы можем посчитать точности совпадений с реальными текстами и посмотреть на полученное значение. По этому показателю мы сможем понимать, написано ли в тексте что-то осмысленное или это просто набор букв. А если точность околонулевая, то возможно текст вообще на другом языке. Такие проверки используются в некоторых алгоритмах криптографии.\n",
    "\n",
    "Выполняя работу, я пробовал рассматривать тексты разной длины: 10000, 50000, 100000 символов. При всех значениях я получал примерно одинаковый результат. Поэтому этот метод будет работать для любых достаточно больших текстов."
